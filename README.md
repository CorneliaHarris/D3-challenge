I accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper and was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The editor wanted to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The first story idea was developed by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). It includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

This project utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** and D3 techniques were used to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.
